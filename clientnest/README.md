# ClientNest

A Flutter-based **Freelancer Management App** for tracking clients, projects, payments, and tasks — powered by Firebase (Authentication + Firestore).

## 🔐 Secure User Authentication

ClientNest uses **Firebase Authentication** to provide a secure and reliable entry point for freelancers. It supports both traditional Email & Password sign-ups and modern Google Sign-In.

### Setup Instructions

To enable authentication in your own instance:
1. **Enable Email & Password**:
   - Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**.
   - Select **Email/Password** and click **Enable**, then hit **Save**.
2. **Initialize Firebase**: Ensure `firebase_core` and `firebase_auth` are in your `pubspec.yaml`.
3. **Configure Options**: Run `flutterfire configure` to generate your `firebase_options.dart`.

### Features
- **Sign Up**: Create new accounts with email, password, and display name.
- **Login**: Securely access your freelance dashboard.
- **Google Auth**: One-tap access using Google accounts.
- **Session Persistence**: Automatic login on app launch via `authStateChanges()`.

### Implementation Details

**Signup Logic:**
```dart
await FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
  email: email,
  password: password,
);
```

**Login Logic:**
```dart
await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
  email: email,
  password: password,
);
```

**Session Tracking:**
```dart
FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges().listen((User? user) {
  if (user != null) {
    debugPrint("Logged in as ${user.email}");
  }
});
```

## Widget Tree Explanation

Flutter builds its UI as a **hierarchical tree of widgets**. Every widget is either a *layout widget* (positions children) or a *leaf widget* (renders visible content). The tree for the `WidgetTreeDemoScreen` (`lib/screens/widget_tree_demo.dart`) looks like this:

```
MaterialApp                         ← root of the whole app
└── Scaffold                        ← page skeleton
    ├── AppBar                      ← top navigation bar
    │   ├── Text  ("Widget Tree …") ← title
    │   └── _AccentDot              ← live colour indicator
    └── body
        └── CustomScrollView        ← scrollable viewport
            └── SliverList          ← lazy list of sections
                └── Column
                    ├── _SectionLabel
                    ├── _WidgetTreeCard     ← static tree visualisation
                    │   └── Card
                    │       └── Column
                    │           ├── Row   (header)
                    │           ├── Container  (tree ASCII)
                    │           └── _InfoChip
                    ├── _SectionLabel
                    ├── _CounterCard        ← setState() counter
                    │   └── Card
                    │       └── Column
                    │           ├── Row   (header)
                    │           ├── ScaleTransition  ← animated counter circle
                    │           │   └── Text  (counter value)
                    │           ├── Row   (+ / – buttons)
                    │           │   ├── _CircleButton  (decrement)
                    │           │   └── _CircleButton  (increment)
                    │           └── _CodeAnnotation
                    ├── _SectionLabel
                    ├── _ProfileCard        ← setState() show/hide toggle
                    │   └── Card
                    │       └── Column
                    │           ├── Row     (avatar + name + chevron)
                    │           └── AnimatedSize  ← collapses/expands
                    │               └── Column  (detail rows)
                    ├── _SectionLabel
                    └── _ThemeSwitcherCard  ← setState() colour rotation
                        └── Card
                            └── Column
                                ├── Row   (colour swatches)
                                ├── AnimatedSwitcher  (active label)
                                └── ElevatedButton  ("Next Colour")
```

> **Key insight:**  Flutter re-renders *only* the sub-tree that changed.
> When you tap **+**, Flutter calls `setState()` → `_CounterCard` rebuilds →
> only the counter `Text` and its `ScaleTransition` are repainted.
> Every other card stays exactly as it was.

---

## State Change Demonstration

The `WidgetTreeDemoScreen` has three interactive reactive examples.

### Example 1 — Counter (`_CounterCard`)

| Moment | `_counter` value | What the UI shows |
|---|---|---|
| Initial load | `0` | Circle displays **0**, `–` button dimmed |
| After 3 taps on **+** | `3` | Circle displays **3**, pulse animation plays |
| After tapping **Reset** | `0` | Returns to initial state |

```dart
// State variable (inside _WidgetTreeDemoScreenState):
int _counter = 0;

// Triggered by the + button:
void _increment() {
  setState(() => _counter++);   // ← Flutter rebuilds _CounterCard
  _pulseController.forward(from: 0);
}
```

### Example 2 — Profile Card Toggle (`_ProfileCard`)

| Moment | `_showDetails` | What the UI shows |
|---|---|---|
| Initial load | `false` | Only avatar + name visible |
| After tapping chevron | `true` | Email, Projects, Rating slide in via `AnimatedSize` |
| After tapping again | `false` | Detail rows collapse |

```dart
bool _showDetails = false;

void _toggleDetails() => setState(() => _showDetails = !_showDetails);
```

### Example 3 — Colour Switcher (`_ThemeSwitcherCard`)

| Moment | `_accentIndex` | Colour applied across all cards |
|---|---|---|
| Initial load | `0` | Indigo `#6366F1` |
| 1 tap | `1` | Emerald `#10B981` |
| 2 taps | `2` | Amber `#F59E0B` |
| 3 taps | `3` | Rose `#EF4444` |

```dart
int _accentIndex = 0;

void _nextAccent() =>
    setState(() => _accentIndex = (_accentIndex + 1) % _accents.length);
```

### UI Before Interaction

> **Screenshot placeholder**
> Run `flutter run`, navigate to the Widget Tree Demo screen, and add a screenshot here.

### UI After Interaction

> **Screenshot placeholder**
> Tap the **+** button several times, toggle the profile card, and cycle the colour — then add a screenshot here.

## Reflection

### 1. How the Widget Tree Helps Flutter Manage Complex UIs

Flutter builds its entire interface as a **hierarchical widget tree**. This structure gives the framework several advantages:

- **Isolation** — each widget manages its own rendering. A change deep in the tree doesn't force the root or its siblings to repaint.
- **Composability** — complex UIs are built by nesting small, single-responsibility widgets (e.g. `_DetailRow`, `_CircleButton`, `_InfoChip`) rather than one monolithic component.
- **Diffing efficiency** — Flutter's engine walks only the *dirty* sub-tree (widgets marked as needing a rebuild) and skips everything else. In the counter example, tapping **+** rebuilds only `_CounterCard`; the `_ProfileCard` and `_ThemeSwitcherCard` above and below it are never touched.
- **Testability** — because every widget is a pure function of its inputs, individual widgets can be pumped in isolation during widget tests without needing the full app.

### 2. Why Flutter's Reactive Model Is Efficient

Flutter uses a **reactive, declarative UI model** — you describe *what* the UI should look like for a given state, and Flutter figures out *how* to get from the current frame to the next one.

- **`setState()` is surgical.** Calling `setState()` marks only the enclosing `State` object as dirty. Flutter schedules a micro-task to call `build()` on that subtree only on the next frame — not the full widget tree.
- **Element tree reconciliation.** Flutter maintains a persistent *element tree* alongside the widget tree. When a widget rebuilds, Flutter compares the new widget description against the existing element and reuses elements whose `runtimeType` and `key` match. Only genuinely new or changed elements are inflated, keeping frame times low.
- **No manual DOM manipulation.** Unlike imperative frameworks, developers never reach into the widget tree to update a specific node. They update state variables (`_counter`, `_showDetails`, `_accentIndex`) and Flutter propagates the change automatically. This eliminates an entire class of bugs caused by out-of-sync UI state.
- **60 / 120 fps rendering.** Because rebuilds are cheap and targeted, Flutter consistently achieves smooth animations even on mid-range devices — as visible in the pulse animation on the counter circle and the `AnimatedSize` expansion in the profile card.

## Stateless vs Stateful Widgets

**Stateless Widgets**
Widgets that display static content and do not change during runtime.

**Stateful Widgets**
Widgets that maintain internal state and update the UI dynamically using `setState()`.

### Code Snippets

**StatelessWidget example**

```dart
class GreetingWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String name;

  const GreetingWidget({required this.name});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text('Hello, $name!');
  }
}
```

**StatefulWidget example**

```dart
class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterWidgetState createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
}
```

---

## Demo Screenshots

Here is how the Stateless vs Stateful screen looks and behaves.

## Reflection: Stateless vs Stateful

**When to use StatelessWidget**
Stateless widgets are used for UI elements that do not change after being built.

**When to use StatefulWidget**
Stateful widgets are required when UI needs to change dynamically during runtime.

**How Flutter rebuilds widgets efficiently**
Flutter rebuilds only the widgets affected by state changes instead of redrawing the entire screen.

---

## Screen Navigation — Flutter Navigator API

This section documents the navigation architecture added in the **Stateful-Widgets** branch.

### Navigation Flow

```
MainScreenWrapper (bottom nav)
    └── HomeScreen  (dashboard tab)
            └── [Navigator API Demo card]
                        └── NavDemoHomeScreen   ← /nav-demo
                                ├── Navigator.push()    → DetailsScreen
                                └── Navigator.pushNamed()  → /details  → DetailsScreen
                                            └── Navigator.pop() → back to NavDemoHomeScreen
```

---

### Named Routes Configuration (GoRouter)

The app uses **GoRouter** for declarative, URL-based navigation. Named paths are registered in `main.dart`:

```dart
final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
  initialLocation: '/',
  routes: [
    GoRoute(path: '/',           builder: (_, __) => const SplashScreen()),
    GoRoute(path: '/auth-wrapper', builder: (_, __) => const AuthWrapper()),
    GoRoute(path: '/landing',    builder: (_, __) => const LandingPage()),
    GoRoute(path: '/login',      builder: (_, __) => const LoginScreen()),
    GoRoute(path: '/signup',     builder: (_, __) => const SignupScreen()),
    GoRoute(path: '/home',       builder: (_, __) => const MainScreenWrapper()),

    // ── Navigation Demo ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
    GoRoute(path: '/nav-demo',   builder: (_, __) => const NavDemoHomeScreen()),
    GoRoute(
      path: '/details',
      builder: (context, state) => DetailsScreen(
        message: (state.extra as Map<String, dynamic>?)?['message'] as String?,
        method:  (state.extra as Map<String, dynamic>?)?['method']  as String?,
      ),
    ),
  ],
);
```

---

### Navigator.push()

Imperatively pushes a new route onto the Navigator stack with a custom slide transition.

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  PageRouteBuilder(
    pageBuilder: (_, animation, __) => const DetailsScreen(
      message: 'Navigated via Navigator.push() 🚀',
      method: 'Navigator.push',
    ),
    transitionsBuilder: (_, animation, __, child) {
      return SlideTransition(
        position: Tween<Offset>(
          begin: const Offset(1, 0),
          end: Offset.zero,
        ).animate(CurvedAnimation(parent: animation, curve: Curves.easeOutCubic)),
        child: child,
      );
    },
  ),
);
```

---

### Navigator.pushNamed() (via GoRouter context.push)

Navigates to a named route and passes typed arguments via GoRouter's `extra`:

```dart
// In NavDemoHomeScreen:
context.push('/details', extra: {
  'message': 'Navigated via Navigator.pushNamed() 📌',
  'method': 'Navigator.pushNamed',
});
```

Receiving arguments in DetailsScreen:

```dart
// Via GoRouter extra:
final goExtra = GoRouterState.of(context).extra;
if (goExtra is Map<String, dynamic>) {
  final message = goExtra['message'] as String?;
  final method  = goExtra['method']  as String?;
}

// Via legacy ModalRoute (also supported):
final message = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as String?;
```

---

### Navigator.pop()

Removes the current route from the stack, returning to the previous screen:

```dart
// In DetailsScreen — tapping the back button:
Navigator.pop(context);

// Or via GoRouter:
context.pop();
```

---

### Demo Screenshots

#### Home Screen — Navigator Demo Card
> Run `flutter run`, log in, go to the Home tab, and capture the **"Navigator API Demo"** card.

#### NavDemoHomeScreen
> Tap the card to open `/nav-demo` and screenshot the two method cards.

#### DetailsScreen
> Navigate to DetailsScreen via either method and screenshot the data-received banner.

---

## Reflection — Navigator API

### 1. What is the role of the Navigator in Flutter?

The `Navigator` is Flutter's built-in widget that manages a **stack of routes** (screens). It provides an imperative API (`push`, `pop`, `pushReplacement`, etc.) allowing you to move between screens at runtime. Each `MaterialApp` creates a default `Navigator` at the root — GoRouter builds on top of it to add declarative, URL-aware routing. Screens lower in the stack remain in memory (their widget tree is preserved), so popping back is instant.

### 2. Why are named routes useful in larger applications?

Named routes (`'/details'`, `'/home'`, `'/profile'`) decouple navigation calls from concrete widget imports. Benefits include:

- **Decoupling** — any widget can navigate to `'/details'` without importing the `DetailsScreen` file, reducing coupling between features.
- **Deep linking** — URL-based paths enable direct navigation from notifications or web URLs.
- **Central route registry** — all routes live in one place (`GoRouter` config in `main.dart`), making the navigation graph easy to audit and refactor.
- **Guards & middleware** — GoRouter supports `redirect` callbacks, making it trivial to protect routes behind auth checks without modifying individual screens.

### 3. How does Flutter manage the navigation stack?

Flutter's `Navigator` maintains an ordered list of `Route` objects. Key mechanics:

| Operation | Effect on Stack |
|---|---|
| `Navigator.push(route)` | Adds `route` on top; previous screen stays alive below |
| `Navigator.pop()` | Removes top route; screen below becomes active |
| `Navigator.pushReplacement(route)` | Replaces top route; previous screen is disposed |
| `Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil(route, pred)` | Pushes route and removes all routes below that don't match `pred` |
| `GoRouter context.push(path)` | Delegate to Navigator.push via GoRouter's internal controller |
| `GoRouter context.go(path)` | Replaces the entire stack with the new path (unlike push) |

When `pop()` is called, Flutter disposes the popped route's widget tree, calls `dispose()` on any `AnimationController`s or streams in that route, and hands focus back to the route below — all in a single frame.
